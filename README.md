## Business Understanding
This documentation outlines the process of developing a machine learning model to predict which NBA teams will qualify for the playoffs in the next season. The project involves analyzing a decade's worth of data from basketball tournaments, encompassing a wide range of information related to players, teams, coaches, games, and various performance metrics
    

### Determine Business Objectives


* **Background:**

At the inception of this project, our organization was faced with the challenge of improving the performance of NBA (National Basketball Association) teams by accurately predicting which teams would qualify for the playoffs in the upcoming season. This challenge stemmed from the highly competitive nature of the NBA, where success and playoff qualification are paramount for team owners, sponsors, and fans.

To address this challenge, we recognized the need to harness the power of machine learning and data analytics. We have amassed a vast dataset comprising 10 yearsâ€™ worth of data from various basketball tournaments, encompassing detailed information about players, teams, coaches, games, and a wide array of performance metrics. Leveraging this wealth of data, we aimed to develop a robust predictive model that could provide insights into which teams were likely to secure playoff berths in the next season
     * The project involves analyzing 10 years' worth of data from basketball tournaments, including information about players, teams, coaches, games, and various metrics. The goal is to use this data to predict which teams will qualify for the playoffs in the next season.
     * Analyze data from basketball tournaments, players, teams, coaches, and games over a 10-year period.


* **Business Objectives:**

The primary business objective of this project is to predict with high accuracy which NBA teams will qualify for the playoffs in the upcoming season. This prediction will enable team owners, managers, and sponsors to make informed decisions regarding team management, marketing strategies, and investments. It will also engage and excite fans by providing them with insights into their team's potential success.

1. Gain insights from the data analysis.
1. Make data-driven decisions.
2. Optimize the decision-making process related to basketball playoffs qualification.
3. Working accurate machine model that determine which teams will get to the playoffs

*  **Business Success Criteria:**

    - Prediction Accuracy: The predictive model should achieve a high level of accuracy in forecasting which NBA teams will qualify for the playoffs. Success will be measured by a predefined accuracy threshold, ensuring that the model provides actionable insights.
    - Profitability: The project should demonstrate a positive impact on team profitability. This includes increased revenue from playoff participation, higher ticket sales, merchandise sales, and enhanced sponsorship opportunities. The success criterion here is a measurable increase in financial metrics tied to playoff qualification.
    - Player and Coaching Insights: The model should provide valuable insights into player and coaching performance, allowing teams to make informed decisions regarding player recruitment, roster composition, and coaching staff.
    - Related Business Questions: The answers to related business questions (e.g., player impact, coaching influence) should provide actionable insights that help the organization make strategic decisions and improve overall team performance.
	


### Assess Situation

* **Inventory of Resources**

*Data Sources*:
Player statistics, team performance metrics, coaching data, game-specific information (e.g., location, date, opponent), and historical playoff qualification records. It is important to note that the quality, completeness, and consistency of this data may vary, and data cleaning and preprocessing will be necessary.

*Constraints*:
Data Availability: While we have data spanning 10 years, there might be gaps, missing values, or inconsistencies in the dataset, which can affect the accuracy of predictions.
Data Privacy: Handling and processing player data, especially health-related information, must adhere to privacy regulations and ethical standards.
Resource Limitations: There may be constraints on computational resources, such as processing power and memory, which could impact model training and scalability.

Assumptions:

* Stationarity: We assume that the underlying patterns in NBA performance data remain relatively stable over time, allowing us to make predictions based on historical data.
* Model Generalization: We assume that patterns and relationships identified in historical data can be generalized to predict future outcomes.
* Causality: While the model can identify correlations, it may not necessarily infer causality between certain variables and playoff qualification
    
   
   (For 10 years, data from players, teams, coaches, games and several other metrics were gathered and arranged on this dataset: This is the dataset that is going to be analyzed in order to make the previsions.
    Software:Python (pandas, numpy, jupyter notebook, google colab, keras))
    

* **Requirements, Assumptions, and Constraints**

 	* **Requirements:**
         - A player needs to have participated in, at least, one game.
 
 	* **Assumptions:**
         - On each season, a coach must guide only one team
 
 	* **Constraints:**
 	     - Time constratint: 24 of november of 2023


* **Risks and Contingencies**
    * Data Quality Issues: There may be missing or inaccurate data in the dataset. Contingency: Data cleaning and imputation strategies will be employed to address missing or erroneous data.

    * Model Accuracy: Predictive models may not perform with high accuracy. Contingency: Iterative model improvement and validation processes will be implemented.

    * Resource Limitations: There may be limitations in computational resources or time constraints. 
    * Contingency: Optimization of algorithms and use of cloud computing resources if necessary.

* **Costs and Benefits**
    * Cost nothing we don't get payed :)
    * Benefits:
        * Improved accuracy in predicting playoff-qualifying teams.
        * Enhanced decision-making in basketball tournament management.

### Determine Data Mining Goals


* **Data Mining Goals**
    * Create prediction models based on historical basketball tournament data to determine which teams will make the playoffs the next season.
    * Determine the key performance indicators (KPIs) and elements that have a significant impact on a team's playoff qualifying.
    * Find patterns and trends in data from players, teams, and coaches that can be used to maximize playoff qualification methods.
    * Develop a thorough grasp of the correlations between numerous indicators (for example, player statistics, team performance, and coaching techniques) and playoff qualification outcomes.
* **Data Mining Success Criteria**
    * Development of high-accuracy predictive models for anticipating playoff-qualifying teams. 
    * Validation of the models through testing and evaluation to ensure their reliability.
